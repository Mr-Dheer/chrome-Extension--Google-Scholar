## ScholarSort: Google Scholar Sorting Extension
### Overview
As a researcher, I rely on Google Scholar daily to explore scholars' profiles and review their publications. However, I noticed a missing feature: the ability to sort publications by year (ascending or descending). Frustrated by the lack of such functionality, I decided to solve the problem by developing ScholarSort, a browser extension that enhances the Google Scholar experience.

### Features
Sort Publications by Year: Easily reorder a scholar's publication list in ascending or descending order based on the year published.
Seamless Integration: The extension works directly on Google Scholar, retaining its intuitive interface while adding sorting capabilities.
Fast and Lightweight: Minimal performance impact while providing a much-needed feature.
### Installation
#### For Chrome
Download the extension files from the GitHub repository.
Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser.
Enable Developer Mode (top-right corner).
Click Load unpacked and select the folder containing the extension files.
The extension is now installed and ready to use.

### How to Use
Visit any Google Scholar profile.
A new Sort By Year button will appear on the profile page.
Click the button and choose:
Ascending: View publications starting from the earliest year.
Descending: View publications starting from the latest year.
The list will automatically reorder as per your selection.

### Development
Tech Stack
JavaScript: For core functionality.
HTML/CSS: For UI enhancements.
